# React Native FlatList Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but hard-to-debug issue in React Native: a blank screen when using `FlatList` due to problems with the data source. The root cause is often subtle inconsistencies in the data structure passed to the `data` prop. The error is not directly reported, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on a simulator or device.
4. Observe the blank `FlatList`. The console might not display a clear error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected implementation. The key is to ensure that the data passed to the `FlatList` is a consistent array of objects with the expected structure.  Careful examination of the data source is crucial for resolving this type of issue.

## Key Learning Points

* Always carefully examine your data structure when using `FlatList` or other list rendering components.
* Use developer tools and logging to inspect the data prop at runtime if you suspect data issues.
* Consider adding error handling and logging to improve the diagnosability of similar issues in your projects.
